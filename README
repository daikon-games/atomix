# Atomix
Atomix is a simple framework for GameMaker that allows you to code in a new way. By utilizing Atomix you'll be able to re-use code/functionality easily across multiple objects in an intuitive way.

## Concepts
Atomix introduces two concepts. The first is an `Atom`. Atoms are GML classes that encapsulate certain properties and behaviors. The second is a `Molecule`. Molecules are the new parent object for all your GameMaker objects. Molecules can have zero or more Atoms attached to them, which will imbue the object with all the properties and behaviors of that Atom.

More to come!
